# Plant Image Recognition

This project is a web application that allows users to upload images of plants and uses image recognition to identify the plant species. It provides information about the recognized plant on the webpage.

- `app.py`: This file contains the Flask application code. It sets up the routes, handles image upload, processes the uploaded image using Python libraries for image recognition, and renders the appropriate templates.

- `templates/index.html`: This file is an HTML template for the homepage of the web application. It includes a form for users to upload images of plants.

- `templates/result.html`: This file is an HTML template for displaying the recognized plant's name and information. It is rendered after the image is processed.

- `static/css/styles.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the web application. It is used to style the HTML templates.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the necessary libraries and dependencies for the project. It ensures that the required Python packages are installed.

## How it Works

1. Flask server setup: The `app.py` file sets up a Flask application. It defines routes for handling different URLs, including the homepage and the image upload endpoint. It also includes the necessary code to start the Flask server.

2. HTML form for image upload: The `templates/index.html` file contains an HTML form that allows users to select and upload an image file. The form has an input field of type "file" that allows users to browse their local file system and select an image file.

3. Python code for image processing and plant recognition: The `app.py` file includes the necessary Python code for processing the uploaded image. It uses Python libraries or APIs for image recognition to analyze the image and recognize the plant. This code can involve image preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms for plant recognition.

4. Display results on the webpage: After the image is processed and the plant is recognized, the `app.py` file renders the `templates/result.html` template. This template displays the recognized plant's name and information, which can be obtained from a database or an external API.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-image-recognition.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to access the web application.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies. They can be installed using the `pip` package manager.

- Flask
- [Additional Python libraries for image recognition]
